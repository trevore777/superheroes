Swift JSON API search app

I am working on some code in SwiftUI in Playgrounds that is connecting to an external JSON API however keeps giving me an error message of "https://superheroapi.com/api/10224715370773368/search/" even though there is no error in the code itself. I have placed the code below and if you could help solve the problem it would be great. Thanks for all your help.
